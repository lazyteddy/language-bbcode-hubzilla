# BBCode package for Atom
This package was made because I couldn't find any BBCode note taking pogram, so I decided to implement BBCodes to Atom, and with a note taking package you'll be able to make BBCode notes

# How to use tips
1. If you want to use the BBCode language as a default for a note use one these extensions: **.bb .bbcode**
2. To enable general spellchecking in BBCode documents add **source.bbcode** to the spell-check package's grammar settings
3. If you want a great note taking package download *![atom-notes](https://atom.io/packages/atom-notes)* and in it's extension settings add **.bb** (make that the first extension if you want to create bbcode notes by default)
